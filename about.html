                <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
                <p>White muse is a name that inspired us to begin this journey, like any other story our started one evening in a facetime call as we were ctaching up during the covid lockdown. As the times got rough for everyone our co-founder "@#$#" had sent each of us a gift set she put together of different fragrances she wanted us to try out. She said and i quote "During this time we tend to get nervers and scared may this scents bring you ease as you go throught your day with your family"</p>
                <h2>THE AHH MOMENT</h2>
                <p>At that moment during that call ass girls do emotions where all over. and it dawned on us. As the days progress andthe times get rought. We all needsome type of comfort and that was the conseption of the idea</p>
                <p>The journey was hard to get the fragrances and the oils and to get the right formulars for every mood with the co intrest to be relaxing and also bringing families and friends together with the gift sets. The support was immense from the people colse to us and we gotto see the joy it brought to each of as and it was all worth it</p>
